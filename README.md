# GameChoice
Sometimes, I just don't know what game I want to play

Utilizing a postgresql database created using the query in the db/ directory, I will be able to filter out what games I want to play based on group size, time to play, theme, and mechanics. 

The app should 
  - be able to add games to the database (not implemented)
  - be able to remove games from the databse (not implemented)
  - be able to change game information in the databse on already existing games (not implemented)
  - be able to filter games based on input queries (not implemented)
  - be able to rank games in order of matching a particular part of the query more strongly than others (not implemented)
